👋 Hello, I'm @Sensen

👀 I'm interested in machine learning, artificial intelligence, and programming. I am fascinated by the potential of these technologies to transform industries and enhance lives.

🌱 I'm currently learning advanced deep learning techniques, with a focus on natural language processing and computer vision. I'm also exploring the ethical implications of AI and how to build responsible AI systems.

💞️ I'm looking to collaborate on open-source projects that aim to solve real-world problems using AI. I'm particularly interested in projects related to healthcare, education, and environmental sustainability.
